Model is trained on RandomForest Classifier and has an accuracy of 85.41%. The link for downloading the model has been given in the Link file.

Futhermore tfidf_vectorizer.pkl and label_encoder.pkl needs to be downloaded to access the function related to model. These can be downloaded by accessing the Model API folder.

If any problem exists then one could re-run the file mdg1.ipynb it would download the required models in your system.
